/**
 * Photo-frame screensaver: an ImmichFrame / Immich Kiosk page rendered full-screen over the
 * dashboard.
 *
 * ★It is an OVERLAY, never an Activity or a DreamService. Backgrounding DashboardActivity is
 * what evicts Camera 0 on Android 10, which kills the RTSP stream (see the stream-wedge notes) —
 * so the photos are drawn in a TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY window and the dashboard stays the
 * foreground activity underneath, still streaming. This is the same trick the wake cover, the
 * talk buttons and the announce orb already use.
 *
 * The page is a JavaScript app, so we render it rather than scraping it — there is no image in
 * its HTML to scrape. The WebView is built on [show] and destroyed on [hide] rather than kept
 * around: a Portal has ~2.8 GB of RAM and the dashboard's own renderer is already the largest
 * process on the device.
 *
 * ## Touch
 * A transparent catcher sits above the WebView and takes every touch, so the page never sees
 * one. That is deliberate: it lets us keep the frame's own left/right navigation *and* still
 * have a way out, which the page alone could not give us.
 *
 *  - left third   → previous photo
 *  - right third  → next photo
 *  - centre third → exit the screensaver (full height)
 *
 * Navigation is delivered as a synthetic `keydown` on `window`, because both frames listen for
 * one and only read `event.key`:
 *   - ImmichFrame: `{ArrowRight: next, ArrowLeft: back, " ": pause, i: showInfo}`
 *   - Immich Kiosk: the same arrows, plus space for play/pause
 * Injecting keys is steadier than synthesising clicks on their invisible edge buttons, which
 * would break the moment either project moves its markup around.

     * Drive the page's own navigation with a synthetic key event.
     *
     * The two frames bind this quite differently, and the dispatch has to satisfy both:
     *  - ImmichFrame: `window.addEventListener("keydown", …)`, switching on `event.key`.
     *  - Immich Kiosk: htmx, declared in the HTML rather than its JS bundle —
     *    `hx-trigger="… keyup[key=='ArrowLeft'] from:body …"`. So it wants **keyup**, and
     *    its listener sits on **body**.
     *
     * Hence: dispatch on `document.body` with `bubbles:true`, and send both keydown and keyup.
     * Bubbling carries it body → document → window, so listeners at any of those three levels
     * fire, and `event.target` is `document.body` — which Kiosk's own JS handler also requires
     * (`if (e.target === document.body)`). Dispatching on `window`, as this used to, reaches
     * window listeners ONLY: events do not propagate downward, which is exactly why Kiosk
     * navigation did nothing while the centre-tap exit still worked.
     *
     * `code` is set alongside `key` because Kiosk's JS switch reads `event.code`; for the arrows
     * the two strings are identical, so one value serves both.
