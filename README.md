# Portal HA Bridge

Turn a **Meta Portal** into a fully-fledged **Home Assistant** device — screen control, camera streaming, motion & presence detection, ambient sensors, sound level, and more — all exposed automatically over **MQTT auto-discovery**. It also turns your Portals into a **push-to-talk intercom** for each other, makes them show up in your phone's **YouTube cast menu** like a smart TV ([Cast YouTube](#cast-youtube-from-your-phone)), and can put **real Amazon Alexa back on the Portal — including Android 10 models** ([Alexa on your Portal](#alexa-on-your-portal)).

It also plugs into a hands-free **voice assistant** ([portal-assistant / "Jarvis"](https://github.com/rudysev/portal-assistant)) so you can control the Portal *and your entire Home Assistant* by voice — see [Voice assistant](#voice-assistant-control-by-voice).

It runs as a persistent background service plus an optional full-screen HA dashboard (kiosk). Nothing is sent anywhere except your own MQTT broker and Home Assistant (voice control additionally uses the assistant's own cloud model under your own key).

## What you get in Home Assistant

Everything below appears automatically as one HA **device** (named whatever you set in the app), via MQTT discovery — no YAML required for the entities themselves.

| Entity | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Screen** | switch | Sleep / wake the display |
| **Screen Timeout** + **Screen Timeout Minutes** | switch + number | On-device idle screen-off timer (works without HA) |
| **Camera** | switch | Master camera power on/off |
| **Camera Streaming** | switch | RTSP H.264 stream on `:8554` (see below) |
| **Motion Detection** | switch | adds **Motion** (binary_sensor) + **Motion Sensitivity** (number) |
| **Portal Presence** | binary_sensor | Occupancy from Meta's *own* face detection, optionally + ambient sound (see below) |
| **Presence Detection** | switch | Enable/disable the presence sensor |
| **Ambient Light** | sensor | lux (`tcs34x0`) |
| **Light R / G / B** | sensors | colour channels (hardware-dependent) |
| **Temperature** + **Temperature Offset** | sensor + number | only on models with an ambient-temp sensor |
| **Sound Level** | sensor | 0–100 ambient loudness (amplitude only, audio never stored) |
| **Tap** / **Tilt** | sensor | knock/tilt gesture direction (`left/right/up/down/front/back`) |
| **Tap/Tilt Sensitivity** | number | threshold slider (also used by **Knock**) |
| **Knock** | event | `double_knock` — two knocks on the frame ([Double knock](#double-knock)) |
| **Dashboard Path** | text | which dashboard the kiosk opens on ([Kiosk pages and navigation](#kiosk-pages-and-navigation)) |
| **Navigate** | text | show any HA page on this Portal now, optionally for N seconds (same section) |
| **Accel X / Y / Z** | sensors | raw accelerometer |
| **Brightness** | number | screen brightness 0–100 |
| **Volume** + **Volume Mute** | number + switch | media volume |
| **Mic Mute** | switch | microphone mute |
| **Doorbell** / **Alert** | buttons | play a tone on the Portal |
| **Ava Keep-Alive** | switch (config) | Android 10 only: keeps an external voice assistant hearing ([below](#keep-an-external-assistant-hearing-on-android-10)) |

Camera, Motion, and Camera Streaming are mutually managed: Motion and Streaming each open Camera 0 and are **mutually exclusive**.

## Supported devices

Meta Portal family on **Android 9 (API 28)** and **Android 10 (API 29)** — Portal (10"), Portal Mini, Portal+ (1st & 2nd gen). One APK covers them all (`minSdk 28`). Sensor availability and a couple of behaviours vary by model — see [Per-model notes](#per-model-notes).

---

## Quick start

### 1. Install + provision

**Windows:**

```powershell
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoadRunner-1024/portal-ha-bridge/main/provision.ps1 -OutFile provision.ps1
Unblock-File .\provision.ps1
.\provision.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoadRunner-1024/portal-ha-bridge/main/provision.sh -o provision.sh
chmod +x provision.sh
./provision.sh
```

Both do the same thing — **nothing needs to be pre-installed**. The script downloads Google's platform-tools if `adb` isn't on your PATH, downloads and installs the latest release APK if the app isn't already on the device, grants every permission/app-op (all require ADB — they can't be granted from the Portal UI), auto-enables the screen-control accessibility service, and prints a green verification checklist. On **1st-gen Portal+ (Android 9)** it also disables a Meta display overlay that rendered the system installer dialog blank — so the **in-app updater** (Settings → System & Updates → *Check for Updates*) and sideloads are visible.

| Flag (Windows / macOS+Linux) | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | install the app if it's missing, then grant everything |
| `-Install` / `--install` | force a reinstall / update to the latest APK |
| `-Apk <path>` / `--apk <path>` | install a specific APK instead of downloading |
| `-SetLauncher` / `--set-launcher` | also set the immortal launcher as the kiosk home |
| `-FreeAlohaMic` / `--free-mic` | free a 1st-gen Portal+ mic for **two-way intercom** (disables Meta's "Hey Alexa" detector; reversible) |
| `-RestoreAlohaMic` / `--restore-mic` | undo `--free-mic` (re-enable "Hey Alexa") |
| `-Alexa` / `--alexa` | provision **Amazon Alexa** (install + grant + amazon.com/code sign-in) — see [Alexa on your Portal](#alexa-on-your-portal) |
| `-Serial <id>` / `--serial <id>` | target a specific device when several are attached |

> Prefer to build it yourself? See [Building from source](#building-from-source) — the provisioner automatically uses your build output if it finds one.
>
> No computer at all? You can install the APK and grant **most** things via the app's own permission prompts — but **screen sleep and Portal presence each need a one-time ADB grant** (`WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` and `READ_LOGS`), because Portal blocks them from its UI. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

### 2. Configure
Open **Portal HA Bridge** on the device and enter your **MQTT broker** host/port/credentials and a **device name** (this becomes the HA device + entity prefix). Save & restart.

The HA device appears automatically.

## Camera streaming (RTSP → Home Assistant)

When **Camera Streaming** is on, the app serves H.264 (Constrained Baseline) at:

```
rtsp://<portal-ip>:8554/
```

It plays directly in VLC. For Home Assistant, the cleanest path is the **WebRTC Camera** custom card. Because the stream carries a mandatory (silent) AAC track that WebRTC can't use, ingest it through go2rtc's ffmpeg with `#video=copy` to drop the audio:

```yaml
type: custom:webrtc-camera
url: 'ffmpeg:rtsp://<portal-ip>:8554/#video=copy'
```

The app's **Camera Settings** screen shows this exact line with the device's own IP filled in.

Notes:
- The H.264 profile is forced to **Constrained Baseline** so browser WebRTC accepts it.
- Audio is intentionally dropped — the Portal mic is reserved for calls and the sound sensor.
- If a **Portal call** grabs the camera, the stream is auto-recovered when you return to the dashboard app.
- Orientation: a manual **Rotate** button is provided; on fixed-orientation Portals you set it once.

### Portal+ camera aspect ratio

The Portal+ front camera ("Smart Camera") only exposes a virtual sensor that scales its field of view into whatever size is requested, so a normal 16:9 request comes out badly stretched. The app corrects this per model:

- **Portal+ 1st gen (`aloha`)** — its usable FOV is ~square, so the stream is encoded **480×480 (1:1)**. It displays correctly in every player with **no extra config**.
- **Portal+ 2nd gen (`cipher`)** — its FOV is 4:3 but the camera is portrait-mounted, so making it upright forces a **480×640** portrait buffer (a 4:3 scene squashed into 3:4). The encoder library can't stamp a pixel-aspect flag, so the 4:3 is applied **viewer-side**. For the HA WebRTC card, add a SAR via go2rtc's ffmpeg — it's a no-re-encode bitstream filter:

  ```yaml
  type: custom:webrtc-camera
  url: 'ffmpeg:rtsp://<cipher-ip>:8554/#video=copy#raw=-bsf:v h264_metadata=sample_aspect_ratio=16/9'
  ```

  In VLC direct, set **Video → Aspect Ratio → 4:3**. (A future encoder-pipeline rewrite could bake the aspect into the stream itself.)

### Show camera feeds only when on (HA dashboard view)

```yaml
type: conditional
conditions:
  - entity: switch.<device>_camera
    state: "on"
card:
  type: custom:webrtc-camera
  url: 'ffmpeg:rtsp://<portal-ip>:8554/#video=copy'
```

## Intercom (Portal-to-Portal announce)

Talk between Portals on your network — hold a button, speak, and it plays out loud on the other Portal(s). It's audio-only and half-duplex ("push to announce"), and it rides the **same MQTT broker** you already use for Home Assistant, so nothing leaves your network. No Home Assistant configuration is needed — it's Portal-to-Portal. All Portals just need to point at the same broker, each with a distinct device name.

- **Hold to Announce** — every dashboard's left-edge drawer has a Hold to Announce button with a target picker: **Everyone** (broadcast) or a **specific Portal**. Hold it, wait for the soft beep (the mic is live — "talk now"), and speak.
- **Floating talk buttons** — optionally show always-on push-to-talk buttons on the dashboard. Create **as many as you like, each named and bound to its own target** (e.g. "Kitchen", "Office", "Everyone"). Double-tap a button to move it, then drag — it locks back into place when you let go.
- **Appearance** — colour (hue / saturation / brightness, including grey), opacity, transparent background, and text colour are all configurable with a **live preview**, in **Settings → Intercom → Talk Button Look**.
- **One at a time** — a network-wide speaking lock means only one Portal talks at once; the rest show "busy" until it's free (and it self-heals if a talker drops off).
- **Volume** — incoming announcements play at a configurable level (Settings → Intercom).

**Receive-only Portals.** A Portal can *send* only if a sideloaded app can get real-time microphone audio. On **Portal+** models, Meta's own always-on far-field mic / "Hey Alexa" detector can hold the microphone and throttle third-party capture, so an affected Portal is **receive-only** — it hears announcements but can't send them. The app measures this automatically at startup and shows a note in **Settings → Intercom**; receive-only Portals simply disable their send controls.

> **Reclaim two-way on a Portal+:** run the provisioner with `--free-mic` (`-FreeAlohaMic`) — or simply provision Alexa (`--alexa` / `-Alexa`), which does it automatically (the bridge's own wake word replaces Meta's detector). Either way it disables `com.millennium`, freeing the mic for transmit **without touching face-presence or Smart-Camera framing** — two-way confirmed working on a 1st-gen Portal+. Reversible with `--restore-mic`.

> Uses `RECORD_AUDIO` for the mic and (for the floating buttons) `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` — both already granted by the provisioner.

---

## Cast YouTube from your phone

Every Portal running the app appears in the **YouTube app's cast menu** (Android and iPhone) on the same Wi-Fi, under its device name — just like a smart TV. Tap it and the Portal plays full-screen YouTube; **all control stays on the phone** (browse, play/pause, seek, queue). A sleeping Portal wakes when you cast. Disconnect on the phone — or long-press the Portal's screen — and it drops back to the Home Assistant dashboard.

- **Zero configuration** — no pairing codes, no accounts on the Portal. Discovery is DIAL on your LAN; playback is YouTube's own TV web client in a WebView.
- **Per-Portal names** — the cast entry uses the device name from Settings, so a fleet shows up as "Portal-Office", "Portal-Kitchen", …
- **Limits** — YouTube only. DRM streaming apps (Netflix, Disney+ …) require Google-certified receivers and can't be supported by any sideloaded app.

---

## Voice assistant (control by voice)

Portal HA Bridge plugs into **[portal-assistant](https://github.com/rudysev/portal-assistant)** ("Jarvis", a hands-free Gemini-powered assistant) as a **tool provider**, so you can control this Portal *and your entire Home Assistant* by voice — without modifying the assistant. Say **"Hey Jarvis, …"** — the wake word is detected **on-device by this app** ([see below](#hands-free-wake-word)):

| Say something like | What happens |
|---|---|
| "turn off the screen" / "wake the screen" | sleeps / wakes this Portal's display |
| "turn the camera on" | toggles the Portal's HA camera stream |
| "is anyone home?" | reports the **Portal Presence** state |
| "turn on Thea's light", "run the goodnight scene", "set the bedroom to 20°" | controls **any** Home Assistant device |

It's implemented via the assistant's public `ToolContract` — an exported `ContentProvider` advertising function-calling tools (only the assistant package may invoke them). For Home Assistant it uses the REST API and can **discover any entity by name**, so it controls every device with **no need to expose entities to HA Assist**.

### Setup
1. Install **portal-assistant** (Jarvis) on the Portal (one-click installer) and give it a free Gemini API key. *(The wake word is handled by this app — see below — so portal-wake isn't required.)*
2. In Jarvis → **Settings → External tools**, switch on **Portal HA Bridge**.
3. Give the bridge a Home Assistant **long-lived access token** (HA → your profile → *Long-Lived Access Tokens*) so it can control HA — two ways:
   - **From Home Assistant (recommended):** paste it into the **HA Token** entity that appears under the Portal device — no typing on the Portal, and you can do it for every Portal from HA.
   - **On the device:** the *HA token* field in Settings, next to the HA URL.

### Hands-free wake word
This app detects the wake phrase **on-device** (a small offline **Vosk** recognizer, on the mic it already holds) and triggers Jarvis via portal-wake's public handoff broadcast — **no separate wake app, and it works on Android 10 Portals**, which portal-assistant otherwise marks "Gen-1 only".

- Enable **On-device wake word** in **Settings → Voice & Assistants**. First enable downloads a ~40 MB model once.
- **The phrase is editable** (default "hey jarvis"), in the field under the toggle. Vosk is grammar-based, so any phrase works — no new model, no retraining.
- **Android 9 (Portal+ 1st-gen):** wakes Jarvis subtly (its background overlay). **Android 10 (Portal / Mini):** Android denies the mic to a background-woken assistant, so the app briefly brings Jarvis to the foreground to let it hear you, then returns to the dashboard — a short per-wake screen takeover.
- Mutually exclusive with **Coexist** below: use *this* to let the app detect the wake word, or *Coexist* to run a separate always-on wake app (e.g. portal-wake) instead.

### Coexist with a voice assistant
Prefer to run a *separate* always-on wake app (e.g. [portal-wake](https://github.com/rudysev/portal-wake)) instead of this app's built-in wake word? The Portal has a single microphone, so turn on **Coexist with voice assistant** (Settings → Voice & Assistants) and the bridge **releases the mic**: the **Sound Level** sensor and sound-based presence turn off, and the intercom captures on-demand only while you're announcing — so the other app can hear "Hey Jarvis" the rest of the time.

### Keep an external assistant hearing on Android 10
On Android 10 Portals (Portal 10", Mini) Meta's audio policy **silences the microphone of any app without a visible activity** - so an always-on assistant that listens from a background service (e.g. [Ava](https://github.com/knoop7/Ava-Pro), `com.example.ava`) records only silence while the dashboard is in front. Android 9 (Portal+) has no such policy.

**Ava Keep-Alive** (on by default, Android 10 only, needs the assistant installed and Coexist on) works around it without covering the dashboard: the bridge opens the assistant's activity in a **freeform window parked off the bottom-right corner of the screen**. Android keeps a 48x32 px sliver of any freeform window on screen; the bridge hides it under a tiny overlay showing the dashboard pixels behind it. The dashboard stays visible and resumed, so the camera keeps streaming, and the assistant owns a visible activity, so it keeps hearing. Whatever moves the dashboard to the front (a wake, a navigate, Show Dashboard, a return from another app) hides the parked window again, so the bridge re-parks it: after its own dashboard starts, on screen on/off, when `logcat -s AudioPolicyService` shows the assistant losing its visible activity or being silenced, and on a 60 s check - never over a call, a cast, a settings screen or another app, and rate-limited. Each park is logged (`adb logcat -s PortalHA | grep keepalive`).

- Needs freeform windowing, which Android reads **at boot**: `adb shell settings put global enable_freeform_support 1`, `adb shell settings put global force_resizable_activities 1`, then **reboot once**. (The bridge sets both itself when they're off - WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS - and waits for the reboot; it checks that its parked window really is freeform before starting the assistant in it, so a full-screen assistant can never cover the dashboard.)
- Switch: **Ava Keep-Alive** entity, or `adb shell am broadcast -a com.aeonos.portalha.DEBUG_CONFIG -p com.aeonos.portalha --ez avaKeepAlive false|true`. Another assistant: `--es keepAlivePackage <package>`. State: `--ez keepAliveStatus true` logs one `keepalive: status ...` line.
- Pause it before driving the assistant's own UI (it runs in the parked window): `--ei keepAlivePauseMinutes N` removes the parked window for N minutes (max 30) and the keep-alive comes back **by itself** when they run out, so an interrupted setup script can't leave the assistant deaf; `--ei keepAlivePauseMinutes 0` ends the pause early. The switch is untouched: switched off (HA or `--ez avaKeepAlive false`) stays off; switching it on ends a pause.
- The corner overlay is re-copied every second, and again 0.4, 1.2 and 2.5 s after each park, page change or wake, so a page still drawing when first copied doesn't stay frozen in the corner.

## Alexa on your Portal

The bridge can put **real Amazon Alexa** back on a Portal — **including Android 10 models**, where Meta's stock "Hey Alexa" wake app is deaf (Android 10 silences microphone capture for background apps). The app's own on-device wake word does the listening and hands the mic to Alexa, bringing her forward invisibly behind a frozen frame of your dashboard for the length of the turn.

**One-time setup (per Portal, over USB):**

1. Run the provisioner with the Alexa flag — Windows:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\provision.ps1 -Alexa
   ```
   macOS / Linux:
   ```bash
   ./provision.sh --alexa
   ```
   Either downloads and SHA-verifies the stock Alexa client, installs it, grants its permissions, and opens the sign-in screen on the Portal.
2. The Portal shows a code — enter it at **amazon.com/code** (any Amazon account region works, including .co.uk). The provisioner then relaunches the client until it connects (a few minutes; keep the cable in).
3. On the Portal: enable **Alexa support** in **Settings → Voice & Assistants**. The wake phrase is editable — the default bare **"alexa"** is the most reliable.

That's the only step that ever needs a cable: it grants permissions to Amazon's app, which no on-device app can do for another package. Everything after — new Alexa features, fixes — arrives with normal app updates.

**Using it:** say **"alexa"**, wait for the **cyan bar / beep**, then speak. Long answers play to the end ("tell me a story" isn't cut off), interactive skills can keep asking you questions, and saying **"alexa"** while she's talking interrupts her. **"alexa stop"** in one breath is understood directly by the bridge: it pauses playing music instantly (no cloud round-trip) and cuts her off mid-story. The very first request after an app restart may hit a cold start: you'll hear a beep as the bridge auto-retries — just repeat the command.

**Notes:**
- **App updates never provision Alexa** — the one-time USB step above is always required first. On unprovisioned Portals the app shows a one-time notice after updating, and the Alexa toggle points you back here; everything else works without it.
- **Android 9 (Portal+ 1st-gen):** no screen takeover is needed — Alexa pops her own story/music card over the dashboard and it stays up while audio plays; the Portal returns to the dashboard when the interaction ends.
- The wake word has no echo cancellation, so audio that itself contains "alexa" can trigger her.
- Alexa support and the Jarvis wake word run side by side — one mic, two assistants, each on its own phrase.

---

## Presence detection

The **Portal Presence** sensor doesn't run our own detection — it piggybacks on Meta's. `PresenceManager` (Aloha) runs face-presence detection on the Portal's *other* camera and logs a heartbeat (~every 30 s) **only while a person is present**, going silent when the room empties. The app tails logcat for that heartbeat: fresh beats = present, no beat for ~50 s = absent.

- Requires the `READ_LOGS` permission (ADB-grantable only).
- Independent of the app's own camera — works with the camera feature off.

### Enhanced presence (camera + sound)

Meta's face detection gets unreliable in **low light** — a person in a dark room can read as absent. Turn on **Enhanced presence (also use sound)** (Settings → Display & Presence) and the **Portal Presence** sensor reports occupied when the camera sees someone **or** the ambient sound rises above a threshold you set. After a noise, it holds "present" for ~60 s (people are only intermittently audible), so the odd footstep or word keeps the room occupied.

- The **Sound threshold** is on the same 0–100 scale as the **Sound Level** sensor. The settings screen shows a **live readout** next to it — glance at it while the room is quiet vs. occupied and set the threshold in the gap (quiet rooms usually sit around 5).
- Uses the microphone (`RECORD_AUDIO`, already granted); needs Presence Detection on.

## Screen control

| Action | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Wake** | `PowerManager` wake lock (`WAKE_LOCK` only) |
| **Sleep** | `AccessibilityService.GLOBAL_ACTION_LOCK_SCREEN` (no device admin) |

Plus an on-device idle timer (**Screen Timeout** / **…Minutes**) that sleeps the screen independently of HA. Presence, a wake and any touch on the app's screens (dashboard, photos, now playing, talk buttons, settings) restart it, and it holds off while a YouTube cast is playing.

---

## Kiosk pages and navigation

**Dashboard Path** (text entity, config) picks the dashboard the kiosk opens on, as a path on your Home Assistant: `/dashboard-kitchen`, `/lovelace/cameras`. The app loads `<HA URL origin><path>`; empty = the HA URL exactly as before. Keep the HA URL in settings as the plain address (`http://192.168.1.5:8123`) — it is also the base for the app's REST calls. Also settable over adb: `adb shell am broadcast -a com.aeonos.portalha.DEBUG_CONFIG --es dashboardPath /dashboard-kitchen`.

**Navigate** puts any page of the same Home Assistant on the Portal right now — a camera view when the doorbell rings — in the dashboard's own web view (no other app, so the camera keeps streaming):

| Topic | Who |
|---|---|
| `portal/<device_id>/navigate` | one Portal (the **Navigate** text entity) |
| `portal/navigate` | every Portal at once (**Navigate (All Portals)** on the *Portal Fleet* device) |
| `portal/<device_id>/navigate/state` | retained: the path being shown, empty while home |

Payload: a path, or JSON:

```json
{"path": "/home-cameras/front_doorbell", "seconds": 180, "dismiss": true}
```

- `seconds` — go back to the dashboard path afterwards (default `0` = stay). Put off while someone is using the page, until 15 s without a touch.
- `dismiss` (default `true`) — wake the screen, take the photo screensaver down and hold it off for `seconds` (the *Screensaver Dismiss Hold* when 0), bring the dashboard to the front. `false` only changes the page, silently.
- `home` (or an empty payload) — back to the dashboard path now.

It's ignored during a call (ringing too) and while a YouTube cast is on screen. Don't publish to these topics with *retain* — a Portal would re-navigate on every reconnect.

```yaml
# Doorbell pressed: show the door camera on every Portal for 3 minutes
action: mqtt.publish
data:
  topic: portal/navigate
  payload: '{"path": "/home-cameras/front_doorbell", "seconds": 180}'
```

---

## Double knock

Knock twice on the Portal's frame (two knocks 150–800 ms apart) and the **Knock** event entity fires `double_knock` — a physical button for any automation. After one it waits 5 s, so a triple knock fires once. Taps on the screen shake the frame too, so a double knock within 400 ms of a touch on any of the app's screens is ignored. The threshold is the **Tap Sensitivity** number (the Tap sensor itself is unchanged).

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: event.<device>_knock
    not_from: [unavailable, unknown]   # coming back online is not a knock
conditions:
  - condition: state
    entity_id: event.<device>_knock
    attribute: event_type
    state: double_knock
```

---

## Per-model notes

- **Temperature / RGB / sensors** are hardware-dependent and auto-detected — entities only appear if the sensor exists.
- **Camera aspect ratio** differs by Portal+ generation — `aloha` streams square (1:1, no config), `cipher` streams 480×640 and needs the one-line 4:3 SAR filter in the HA card. See [Portal+ camera aspect ratio](#portal-camera-aspect-ratio).
- **Camera orientation**: both Portal+ models have a **fixed camera** (it doesn't pivot with the screen), so accelerometer auto-rotate is disabled for them and the stream uses a fixed rotation — upright out of the box (`aloha` rot 0, `cipher` rot 90), adjustable with the in-app **Rotate** button. Auto-rotate still applies to non-Portal+ models.
- **Portal+ 2nd gen (`cipher`)**: its accelerometer is mounted on the **moving screen arm**, which heavily dampens taps — so the tap threshold is auto-scaled, the gesture is relabelled **"Tilt"**, and its dominant (Z) axis reports **up/down** instead of front/back. All automatic — no config.
- **Intercom**: **every model can be two-way.** Out of the box a **Portal+** has Meta's "Hey Alexa" detector holding the far-field mic, which makes it receive-only — the provisioner frees it (`--free-mic`), and **provisioning Alexa (`--alexa` / `-Alexa`) frees it automatically** (the bridge supplies its own wake word instead). Capability is measured automatically at startup either way — see [Intercom](#intercom-portal-to-portal-announce).

---

## Permissions

All ADB-granted (they can't be granted from the Portal UI). The provisioner (`provision.ps1` on Windows, `provision.sh` on macOS/Linux) does these for you:

| Permission / app-op | Used for |
|---|---|
| `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` | auto-enable the screen-sleep accessibility service |
| `CAMERA` | streaming / motion |
| `RECORD_AUDIO` | ambient sound-level sensor + intercom microphone |
| `READ_LOGS` | Portal presence sensor |
| `WRITE_SETTINGS` (app-op) | read/set brightness |
| `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` (app-op) | background camera access + floating intercom buttons |

---

## Building from source

- **Android Studio** (or Gradle CLI) — JDK 17.
- Kotlin 2.0.20, AGP 8.3.2, Gradle 8.6, `compileSdk 35`, `minSdk 28`.
- RTSP camera uses `com.github.pedroSG94:RTSP-Server:1.3.0` + `com.github.pedroSG94.RootEncoder:library:2.4.6` (this exact pair) via JitPack.

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Signing:** release builds read `keystore.properties` (in the project root) for the signing key. That file and the `.keystore` are **git-ignored** — keep your own; losing them means you can't sign updates that install over an existing install.

## Troubleshooting

- **Camera "1 frame then freezes" in HA** → use the `ffmpeg:…#video=copy` URL (drops the AAC track); ensure the app is recent (Constrained Baseline profile).
- **No screen sleep** → `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` not granted; run the provisioner (`provision.ps1` / `provision.sh`), or use the single grant in SETUP.md.
- **Camera "can't open from background"** → re-open the dashboard app (it re-acquires the camera in the foreground).
- **Provision says "no device"** → check `adb devices`, re-plug, accept the USB-debugging prompt.
