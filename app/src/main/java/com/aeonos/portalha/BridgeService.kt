     *
     * It does nothing while our dashboard is in front, because FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON blocks the
     * timeout path outright; it only applies in the windows where something else owns the screen,
     * after a boot or a foreground steal. Reported from the field: dropping it to a minute was
     * what let the app be "left alone on top of the launcher", because the OS reaches its
     * ambient/sleep decision sooner and the launcher stops sitting there.
     *
     * Off by default and fully reversible — the previous value is remembered and put back — since
     * this is a system-wide setting the owner may have chosen deliberately. Needs WRITE_SETTINGS,
     * which the app already holds for the brightness slider.
