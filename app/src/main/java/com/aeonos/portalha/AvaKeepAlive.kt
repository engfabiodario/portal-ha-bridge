/**
 * Keeps an external voice assistant (fleet: Ava, com.example.ava) able to HEAR on Android 10
 * Portals (Portal 10" "omni", SDK 29) without ever covering the dashboard.
 *
 * ## Why
 * Meta's AudioPolicyService carries a "ProcessPolicy" that silences a recorder unless its
 * process has a VISIBLE activity. Measured (logcat -s AudioPolicyService):
 *     ProcessPolicy: onForegroundActivitiesChanged() <uid>/<pid> -> 0
 *     ProcessPolicy: onUidForeground() silencing for <uid> -> 0
 *     Setting App state for uid = <uid>, state = 0        <- the recorder now gets zeros
 * A voice assistant that runs from a foreground service (Ava) therefore records silence while
 * our dashboard is in front, i.e. always. Android 9 (Portal+) has no such policy.
 *
 * ## How
 * With freeform windowing enabled (Settings.Global enable_freeform_support=1 and
 * force_resizable_activities=1, read by the system at BOOT only) we "park" the assistant: a
 * transparent activity of ours ([AvaKeepAliveActivity]) is started in its own task, in a freeform
 * window whose launch bounds lie off the bottom-right corner, and it starts the assistant's launcher
 * activity INSIDE that task (no NEW_TASK), so the assistant's activity lives in a freeform task we
 * own. WindowManager keeps 48x32 dp of any freeform window on screen; Android draws only that
 * sliver, the dashboard stays visible and resumed (multi-resume) so the camera keeps streaming,
 * and the assistant's process owns a visible activity so it is not silenced.
 * Owning the task matters: an existing task keeps its windowing mode whatever the launch options
 * say, so starting the assistant's OWN task could bring it up full screen (someone opened it from
 * the launcher, a setup script drove its UI) - covering the dashboard and killing the stream. Our
 * task is always created by us, in freeform, and if freeform turns out not to be active on this
 * boot our activity sees it (isInMultiWindowMode false), removes its task and never starts the
 * assistant - our own translucent activity on top is camera-safe.
 * The sliver is hidden under a tiny overlay of ours showing the dashboard pixels behind it
 * (PixelCopy of the dashboard window), plus a transparent touch guard over the sliver itself so a
 * finger in the corner can't drag the parked window on screen by its caption.
 *
 * Every activity start on the display (ours: a wake, a navigate, Show Dashboard, the steal return;
 * or anyone else's) moves the fullscreen stack above the parked window, and the policy silences the
 * assistant again seconds-to-minutes later. So we re-park (bring our task back to the front):
 *  - shortly after each of our own dashboard starts/resumes ([request] from BridgeService),
 *  - on screen on/off,
 *  - when our logcat reader sees the assistant's uid lose its visible activity or get silenced,
 *  - on a periodic safety tick, and once at start (boot).
 * Never while a call, a cast, one of our own settings screens or another app has the screen, never
 * in a tight loop (minimum gap + rate limit with exponential backoff), and every park is logged with
 * its reason ("keepalive: park #n (<reason>) ...").
 *
 * The corner cover is re-copied every 3 s, plus a burst at +0.4/+1.2/+2.5 s after each park, page
 * change, wake and cover show, so a page that was still drawing when it was first copied doesn't
 * stay frozen in the corner. Copies run on a thread of their own (PixelCopy blocks its caller).
 *
 * Two ways to turn it off: the user's switch ([setEnabled], HA "Ava Keep-Alive"), which stays off,
 * and a timed pause for setup scripts ([pauseUntil], at most [MAX_PAUSE_MINUTES]) that ends BY
 * ITSELF, so a script interrupted while it drives the assistant's own UI can't leave it deaf.
 *
 * A no-op below SDK 29, when the assistant isn't installed, when the switch is off or paused.
